# adb-auto-restarter
ADB service auto restarting shell. really helpful if you are as lazy as i am and don't want to restart your adb service manually when it stops detecting your android phone.

# How To Use
you don't need to do much, just run the following command in order to run the shell on your system
```
make run
```
or
```
chmod +x adb-service
./adb-service
```

# important
This script file has been developed on macOSX and not sure about compatibility on linux. test and contribution would be appreciated
